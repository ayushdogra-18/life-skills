# Tiny Habits + Atomic Habits (Quick Reflection)

## Question 1: Most interesting story/idea
**Answer:** The most interesting idea is that even very small habits—like doing 1 push-up or pull-ups—lead to real long-term change. This works because you don’t need strong motivation; the habit is so easy that you can do it every day, and consistency slowly builds progress.

## Question 2: What is B = MAP?
**Answer:** B = MAP means a behavior happens only when **Motivation**, **Ability**, and **Prompt** come together.
- **Motivation:** how much you want to do it
- **Ability:** how easy it is to do
- **Prompt:** a reminder or trigger to act

## Question 3: Why is "Shine" / Celebrate important?
**Answer:** Celebration is important because it gives your brain a positive feeling. That good feeling helps the brain remember the habit and learn it faster.

## Question 4: Most interesting story/idea
**Answer:** The best idea is that small improvements add up over time. Getting just 1% better every day may feel small at first, but after weeks and months, it creates a big and meaningful change.

## Question 5: Book’s perspective about Identity
**Answer:** *Atomic Habits* explains that habits are not just about getting results; they are about who you become. Every small habit you do is like a vote for the type of person you want to be.

## Question 6: How to make a habit easier to do?
**Answer:** The book explains that habits become easier when you reduce friction. By making a habit obvious, simple, and easy to start, you don’t need much motivation to do it every day.

## Question 7: How to make a habit harder to do?
**Answer:** To break a habit, make it harder by increasing friction: remove cues, add obstacles, and reduce rewards so the habit becomes annoying and less automatic.

## Question 8: One habit I want to do more of
**Answer:** Habit: Eating enough food every day.
### Simple steps:
- Keep food and snacks visible and ready so you remember to eat.
- Make it easy by preparing meals in advance or keeping quick foods like bananas, nuts, eggs, milk, and bread.
- Make it enjoyable by eating high-calorie foods that you actually like.
- Make it satisfying by tracking your meals as a streak or giving yourself a small reward after finishing meals.

## Question 9: One habit I want to eliminate or reduce
**Answer:** Habit: Late-night phone scrolling.
### Simple steps:
- Keep your phone away from the bed so you don’t see it.
- Turn off notifications to reduce temptation.
- Use app blockers to make scrolling harder.
- Replace scrolling with a book or calm music so using the phone feels unnecessary.
